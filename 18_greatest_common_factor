# Write a method that takes in two numbers. Return the greatest
# integer that evenly divides both numbers. You may wish to use the
# `%` modulo operation.

# Difficulty: medium.

#inputs: two integers
#process: In this method I will be using some && and ||s.  
# There will also need to be a way to choose the GREATEST common factor.  
#outputs: One integer(the greatest integer that evenly divides both numbers)

# These are tests to check that your code is working. After writing
# your solution, they should all print true.
